# Unity Workspace

This folder hosts the Unity project that exports the libraries consumed by the Expo application.

- **iOS / Android**: Generate a Unity as a Library export (commonly `UnityExport`) and point the config plugin paths accordingly.
- **WebGL**: Export your WebGL build into `../web/public/unity/` so it can be served by the web workspace.
